    <h1>Voting Analysis: Georgia & Texas</h1>
    
    <div class="project-intro">
      <p>
        This project explores partisan shifts and voter turnout in Georgia and Texas over recent election cycles. 
        Using publicly available voting data, I cleaned and organized the information in Excel, wrote a Python script 
        to calculate vote percentages, and visualized the results using multiple comparative charts and analyses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Georgia and Texas were chosen due to their contrasting electoral trends: Georgia's recent swing toward 
        Democratic candidates and Texas's evolving but traditionally Republican base. By analyzing this data over time, 
        the project sheds light on broader regional political dynamics and highlights the importance of voter engagement 
        and demographic shifts.
      </p>

    <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Georgia 2020 Result:</strong> Biden won with 49.5% vs Trump's 49.3% (0.2% margin)</li>
      <li><strong>Texas 2020 Result:</strong> Trump won with 52.1% vs Biden's 46.9% (5.2% margin)</li>
      <li><strong>Most Competitive County:</strong> Williamson County, TX (49.8% Biden vs 48.5% Trump)</li>
      <li><strong>County Analysis:</strong> 89 Georgia counties vs 45 Texas counties</li>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> Our county-level analysis shows different patterns than state-level results due to data source differences</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visualizations:</h3>
    
    <div class="visualization-section">
      <h4>1. Actual 2020 Election Results</h4>
      <img src="projects/voting-analysis/visualizations/actual_2020_results.png" alt="Actual 2020 election results showing Biden winning Georgia" class="project-image" />
      <p>
        These pie charts show the actual 2020 election results: <strong>Biden won Georgia</strong> with 49.5% of the vote 
        compared to Trump's 49.3% (a 0.2% margin), while Trump won Texas with 52.1% compared to Biden's 46.9%. 
        This visualization clearly demonstrates Georgia's historic swing toward Democratic candidates in 2020.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="visualization-section">
      <h4>2. Margin of Victory Analysis</h4>
      <img src="projects/voting-analysis/visualizations/2020_margin_of_victory.png" alt="Margin of victory analysis for 2020 election" class="project-image" />
      <p>
        This bar chart shows the margin of victory (Biden percentage minus Trump percentage) for each state. 
        Georgia shows a narrow Biden victory (+0.2%), while Texas shows a clear Trump victory (-5.2%). 
        The visualization highlights how Georgia became a competitive swing state in 2020.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="visualization-section">
      <h4>3. Vote Percentages by Candidate (State Level)</h4>
      <img src="projects/voting-analysis/vote_percentages_chart.png" alt="Vote percentages comparison between Georgia and Texas" class="project-image" />
      <p>
        This grouped bar chart compares the percentage of votes received by each major candidate (Biden, Trump, Jorgensen) 
        in Georgia and Texas during the 2020 election. It visually highlights the partisan differences between these 
        contrasting states, showing how each candidate performed at the state level.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="visualization-section">
      <h4>4. County-Level Biden vs Trump Scatter Plot</h4>
      <img src="projects/voting-analysis/visualizations/county_biden_vs_trump.png" alt="County-level Biden vs Trump vote percentages scatter plot" class="project-image" />
      <p>
        This scatter plot shows the relationship between Biden and Trump vote percentages across all counties in Georgia and Texas. 
        Each point represents a county, with Georgia counties in blue and Texas counties in red. The diagonal line represents 
        equal vote share. This visualization reveals the distribution of partisan support at the county level and shows 
        which counties were most competitive.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="visualization-section">
      <h4>5. County Vote Distributions by State</h4>
      <img src="projects/voting-analysis/visualizations/county_vote_distributions.png" alt="County vote distributions for Georgia and Texas" class="project-image" />
      <p>
        These histograms show the distribution of Biden and Trump vote percentages across counties in Georgia and Texas. 
        They reveal the clustering of partisan support and highlight the different electoral landscapes in each state. 
        Georgia shows more variation in county-level support, while Texas demonstrates stronger Republican dominance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="visualization-section">
      <h4>6. County Comparison Chart</h4>
      <img src="projects/voting-analysis/visualizations/county_comparison.png" alt="Number of counties comparison between Georgia and Texas" class="project-image" />
      <p>
        This bar chart compares the number of counties in Georgia (89) and Texas (45), providing context for the 
        administrative size of each state. This information is crucial for understanding electoral dynamics and 
        data interpretation across different state structures.
      </p>

    <div class="visualization-section">
      <h4>7. Correlation Matrix: County-Level Voting Patterns</h4>
      <img src="projects/voting-analysis/visualizations/county_correlation_matrix.png" alt="Correlation matrix of county-level voting patterns" class="project-image" />
      <p>
        This heatmap displays the correlation matrix between key county-level voting variables: <strong>Biden_pct</strong> 
        (Biden vote percentage), <strong>Trump_pct</strong> (Trump vote percentage), <strong>Jorgensen_pct</strong> 
        (Jorgensen vote percentage), <strong>total_votes</strong> (total votes cast), <strong>margin</strong> 
        (absolute difference between Biden and Trump percentages), <strong>biden_advantage</strong> (Biden percentage 
        minus Trump percentage), and <strong>total_votes_log</strong> (logarithm of total votes). The analysis reveals 
        strong negative correlations between Biden and Trump support (-1.00), indicating counties that strongly support 
        one candidate tend to weakly support the other. The matrix also shows relationships between vote totals and 
        candidate support, providing insights into how county size relates to partisan preferences.
