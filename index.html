      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        I'm a rising junior at Tufts University majoring in Philosophy with minors in Political Science and History. My academic interests center on political theory, legal thought, and the intersection of philosophical ideas with current events. I'm especially drawn to questions about justice, rights, and power, and how they shape the legal and political systems we live under.
        Outside of academics, I am passionate about activism, particularly around healthcare accessibility and reproductive justice. I am interested in how policy and philosophy intersect in these areas, and how lived experience informs both.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        As the Summer 2025 Development and Operations Intern at the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation’s New England Chapter, I’ve supported the Foundation’s mission through both logistical and advocacy-related projects. One of my core contributions was creating a comprehensive guide for school nurses and educators on supporting students with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). This resource aims to improve understanding of chronic illness in school settings and promote inclusive practices. I’ve gained firsthand insight into how nonprofit organizations operate. I’ve worked on initiatives that support patient education and legislative advocacy, while also learning to navigate Salesforce for data management, outreach tracking, and campaign organization. This experience has deepened my understanding of how grassroots efforts intersect with systemic change, especially in the context of healthcare equity.
